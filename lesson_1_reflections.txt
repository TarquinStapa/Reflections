The first lesson was very insightful
first i understood the FC command prompt in Windows Comand prompt.
Second I had to install git
Third I had to install a text editor like Sublime
Finally I had to navigate to Sublime by creating version-control folders 
in Git Bash and then type out this reflections
A good start to understanding Git and GitHub

History and Efficiency

Reviewing some old methods of version control was interesting. Manually saving old versions seems quite tedious.
What I didnt know is that software like dropbox, google docs and wikipedia have version control options available. 

Manual Commits

Having to manually save allows you to understand what you have changed.
It also helps break down your progress in your mind for what you are working on.
Auto save would save randomly and wouldnt allow you to see speciffically what you were working on.
