When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 	It would be beneficial to do this to allow me to work and add to the repository from a different Computer.
  	It would also allow for someone else to add to the repository themselves.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	This is because external collaborators could have made change to the repository and could cause conflicts.
	By pulling the changes, they can be reviewed and added or removed if wanted.
